#Data integratie project

--> mvnw and mvnw.cmd 

These files are from Maven wrapper. It works similarly to the Gradle wrapper.

This allows you to run the Maven project without having Maven installed and present on the path. It downloads the correct Maven version if it's not found (as far as I know by default in your user home directory).

The mvnw file is for Linux (bash) and the mvnw.cmd is for the Windows environment.
